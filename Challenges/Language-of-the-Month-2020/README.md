# Language of the Month 2020
Simple programs written in a variety of languages for the sake of learning! 

Each month, I study a new, lesser-known language, set up the appropriate coding environment, and have fun either coding classic algorithms or mini projects!


|  Month   |      Language, Year Released     |      Paradigm     |     Tooling     |     Project      |                              Thoughts                               | 
|----------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| January  |      Clojure, 2005      |     functional    |  IntelliJ/Lein  |   [To Do App](https://github.com/kyleecodes/ToDoApp-Clojure)      |   Modern-day, generalist Lisp.
| February |     Smalltalk, 1972     |   object-oriented |    Squeak IDE   |  Just functions  |  The "original OOP", Squeak IDE is super powerful!
|  March   |      Racket, 1995       |     functional    |    Dr Racket    |  Just functions  |   Minimal Lisp, data visualizations in Racket IDE are seamless.
|  April   |      Scheme, 1970       |     functional    |    Pen & Paper    |  [Book - The Little Schemer](https://vpb.smallyu.net/[Type]%20books/The%20Little%20Schemer.pdf)    |   Excellent pen & paper functional programming experience with lessons on introductory computer science. 
|   May    |      Golang, 2009       |   multi-paradigm  |      Goland     |   "Hello World"      |  Syntactically similar to C, but with garbage collection & allocation abstracted away. 
|  June    |      Haskell, 1990      |     functional    |      Vim        |  Just functions  | Not very Windows friendly, so I used my Raspberry Pi and Vim. I practiced Haskell by combining it with my study of alternative data types -- like monads! Monads are fascinating because they're almost like custom data types, composed of expressions. I admire Haskell for it's mathematical nature. |
|  July    |       Ruby, 1995        |   OOP, multi-paradigm  |     RubyMine    | A pig latin translator |  Very similar to Python (both high-level, interpreted, server-side rendering, general purpose, dynamically typed) except differences in syntax, variable & method declaration, and built-in functions (Ruby doesnâ€™t have many functions; it has only methods that have to be wrapped in procs to pass them).  |
|  August  |      Clojure (Revisited), 2005      |  functional  |  Online sandbox |  Just functions  |  I revisited Clojure from January.  |
|September |      Scala        |   multi-paradigm |     IntelliJ    |       WikiCrawler from [Functional Programming: Simplified: Scala Addition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1979788782/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)      | Another language on the JVM. This is basically Java with half the lines of code ;) |
| October  |        R          |   multi-paradigm  |     IntelliJ    |  Next location analysis by [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses-all)  | Being a statistical computing language, I was excited for R. I genuinely love mathematical languages. Over the summer I helped my employer decide where to open their next location, I figured I could experiment with using data and Datacamp as guide to make the most informed decision. Also, IntelliJ has excellent support for R! |
| November |      Julia        |   multi-paradigm  | Juypter Notebook |   Data science functions    | I've heard a quote about Julia somewhere, "Writes like Python, runs like C!" and I can definitely agree with that! A statistical computing language, like R, but with more capabilities. Lisp-like macros, powerful shell-like functions, designed for parallelism and distributed programming.  |
| December |      -      |     -    |       -      | -  |    I focused on discrete structures this month.         |
